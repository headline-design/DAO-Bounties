# DAO-Bounties
 Github repo for Algorand DAO Bounties

Introducing DAO Bounties, a HEADLINE project to build the first Algorand DAO toolkit. We are committing 10,000 Algos plus the cost of auditing services to support the development of essential DAO infrastructure on Algorand.

The first DAO Bounty will be for DAO Deposit, a tool that facilitates DAO liquidity creation and investment. Bounties will be released via Gitcoin.
